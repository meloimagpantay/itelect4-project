// NOTE: That token was a string this file made up. Nothing checked it,
//       because nothing could -- ProtectedRoute only ever asked whether
//       it was null. A real token is issued by /api/auth/login and
//       signed with a secret only the API knows.
// ===== SESSION 10: the store keeps a token it was given ==============

// This file deliberately does not import ../api/client. client.ts
// reads the token out of this store on every request, so a store that
// called client.ts back would be an import loop. Keeping the fetching
// in the pages and the state here means the arrow only points one way.

// The token is good for two hours -- that is the expiresIn in
// itelect4-backend's login route. Persist keeps it across a reload,
// so the app can come back holding one the API has already stopped
// accepting: the next request answers 401, and Log out then log in
// again is the fix.
